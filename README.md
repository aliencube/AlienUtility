This provides various utilities that might be necessary for other developers.


## `AppUtility` Class ##

This class provides useful methods that can be used for both web apps and Windows apps.


### `MapPath()` Method ###

Traditionally, the `MapPath()` method has only been used for web apps. Now, it can be used for Windows apps like console apps, WinForm apps, WPF apps and Universal apps, as long as .NET Framework is used! Its usage can't simpler:

```csharp
var appUtil = new AppUtility();
var fullpath = appUtil.MapPath("~/Test");
```

It also provides more powerful method, `TryMapPath()`, which checks if the path exists or not.

```csharp
var appUtil = new AppUtility();

string fullpath;
var result = appUtil.TryMapPath("~/Test", out fullpath);
```

The benefits of using this method are:

* You can use this for your Windows apps such as console apps, WinForm apps, WPF apps and Universal apps.
* You don't have to rely on the `Server.MapPath()` method for your web apps any more.
* You can avoid one of top OWASP security vulnerabilities, [Path Traversal](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Path_Traversal).

The only thing you need to remember for this method is:

* For apps other than web apps, this method assumes the app directory as the root directory.
* In order to provide the path for outside the app directory, it should be the absolute path like `C:\Temp`.
